# First ansible playbook here!

# Ansible is based on playbooks like this one, where we use ansible commands to build an automation script, we have named this play "Configuring RaspberryPi"

# The hosts key refers to the systems where this playbook is going to be installed, here only our RaspberryPi4, but could be many systems with only one playbook 
# The group of hosts where we are applying ansible playbook is refered as "the inventory"

# The become key is used to grant ansible administrator (sudo) privileges on the machine.

# A playbook can have several tasks, each of them precedeed by a dash
# Here, we have a task name "Install my favourite browser"

# Tasks make use of the ansible modules to perform actions, for example here, the module is "package" which is used to install packages
# Each ansible module has a documentation page where how is it used is explained (also some useful code snippets are provided)
# For example the documentation of the package module is here https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/package_module.html
