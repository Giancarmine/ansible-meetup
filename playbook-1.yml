# First ansible playbok here!

# A playbook is where we use ansible commands to build an automation script
# A playbook is formed by plays, each of them is introduced by its name, for example, this ansible playbook have one play named "Configuring RaspberryPi"

# Then, each play can have several tasks, each of them precedeed by a dash
# Here, we have a task name "Install my favourite browser"

# Tasks make use of the ansible modules to perform actions, for example here, the module is "package" which is used to install packages
# Each ansible module has a documentation page where how is it used is explained (also some useful code snippets are provided)
# For example the documentation of the package module is here https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/package_module.html
