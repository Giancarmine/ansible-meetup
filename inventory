# Ansible inventory here!
# - This file stores information to connect the control node with the target machines where our ansible tasks are going to be applied
# - If this file is not present, ansible will use a defalt inventory located in /etc/ansible/hosts
# - Therefore we should explicitly tell ansible to use this file (we will see it in a moment)
